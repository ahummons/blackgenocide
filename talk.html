            <article>
                    <h3>Our struggle is fighting anti-blackness not non-whiteness. </h3>
                   <b>By framing Our struggle and anti-blackness we can see the true enemies wait it's in POC because anyone that falls outside of blackness has the potential to be an enemy not experiencing the same struggle as Our blackness. </b> 
                    Race is a physical characteristics associated with human beings. Race is perceived by others based on skin color. Anti-Blackness is a bias towards people of darker skin.

                <h3>POC Anti-Blackness</h3>
                <p>
                        POC is term used by non-whites seeking sympathy from black folks. 
                        POC does not equal black.
                </p>
                <p>
                        POC is the term used by non-black folks to claim a state of temporary blackness. Especially when they want to either garner sympathy for black folks or to engage in the (minimal) legal protections that we bleed and die for every day.

            <h3>Empathy is Not a Given</h3>
<p>
POC is a person of temporary blackness. False allies Who desire the support of the black collective in their time of need.

           <b> Laugh to Keep From Crying ... </b> Sometimes we use humor to cope. But Anti-Blackness is not a laughing matter.

    <h3>Anti-Black and Queer</h3>
    <p> Ethnicity and Sexuality are often implied until confirmed. 
            Anti-Blackness in the LGBTQ Community is not surprising because Race is based on skin color.</p>
