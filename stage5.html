<h2>Polarization</h2>

<h3>Opinion</h3>

<p>Polarization of America based on race and class has deepened in the past 8 years. The election of President Obama was touch much for the frail white-supremacist psyche. Fox News, CNN, Briebart and other trash news outlets waged an all out Smear campaign against people of color in America, especially black people. The media has practiced the guilty till innocent approach with black people since the advent of the television. Every bigot with a platform adopted the &ldquo;perceived threat&rdquo; talking points whenever discussing black people. This isn&rsquo;t new, look at the lack of and then biased coverage of Hurricane Katrina. Although this was a natural disaster; the media focus was on how to erase any fragment of empathy for the victims. Hell, even our &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; president at the time, Bush Jr. ignored the plight and let his white sheet slip out his pants. We can all out the BS on the news but it continues because they need to uphold the status quo. To allow black people to be viewed as human would awaken the intelligent Americans eyes to the American Genocide.</p>

<h2>Polarization Defined by Genocide Watch</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html" target="_blank">From the 8 Stage of Genocide By Gregory Stanton </a></h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;Extremists drive the groups apart. Hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda. Laws may forbid intermarriage or social interaction. Extremist terrorism targets moderates, intimidating and silencing the center. Moderates from the perpetrators&rsquo; own group are most able to stop genocide, so are the first to be arrested and killed.&rdquo; </em></p>
