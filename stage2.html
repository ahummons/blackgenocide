<h3>Symbolization</h3>

<h4>Opinion</h4>

<p>The naming and use of symbols to represent the group of people identified as Other. We are labeled black and n-word. We are symbolized as lazy worthless and immoral. Symbolization of African Americans or other groups is not new. Negative symbolization that represents hate is ongoing. Like white sheets and burning crosses, nooses, water hoses and rabid police dogs and now black hoodies and candy also make you dangerous. Swastikas, and 88 tattoos promote fear in those of Jewish fate but also in the hearts of African-Americans. From the racist caricatures of Tom and Jerry to the medias continued portrayal of young black men as criminals, the negative symbolization is ongoing and embedded in American society. Symbolization is the foundation of the next stage, <a href="stage3.html">Dehumanization</a>.</p>

<h3>Symbolization Defined by Genocide Watch</h3>

<h4><a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html" target="_blank">From the 8 Stage of Genocide By Gregory Stanton </a></h4>

<p><em>&ldquo;We give names or other symbols to the classifications. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stage1.html">Classification</a> and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to the next stage, dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups&rdquo; </em></p>
