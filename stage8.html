            <h2>Denial</h2>
            <h3>Opinion</h3>

          <p> 
          Denial is a constant as the African-American Genocide progress and recycles. Denial of past and current atrocities is paramount to the success of the genocide. Denials of slavery in America or the sift in focus to “include” the white slaves (who were indentured servants). The inclusion of the false narrative that black first owned slaves. The agents of genocide change the scope of the argument to broaden the terms. This is a tactic to shift focus from the genocidal acts. Denial allows the agents of genocide to shift blame to the victims that have already been dehumanized. 
Denial involves spreading partial truths and engaging in selective fact finding. Revisionists are cloaked agents of genocide. They search for facts that support their distorted re-telling of past and currents genocidal events while ignoring any facts that disputes their “new” version. 
</p>
<p>
Denial is also referred to as <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold"> “White-washing” </span>. Revisionists are white-washers who distort the narrative to place the oppressors in a most favorable light. White-washing is a way for the agents of genocide to obsolve themselves of responsibility.

            <h2>Denial Defined By Genocide Watch</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html" target="_blank">From the 8 Stage of Genocide By Gregory  Stanton </a></h3>

          <p>
            <em>"DENIAL is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims. They block investigations of the crimes, and continue to govern until driven from power by force, when they flee into exile. The response to denial is punishment by an international tribunal or national courts. . Even during the genocide, those committing the crimes dismiss reports as propaganda. Afterwards such deniers are called “revisionists.” Others deny through more subtle means: by characterizing the reports as “unconfirmed” or “alleged” because they do not come from officially approved sources; by minimizing the number killed. </em>
