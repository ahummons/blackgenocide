            <h2>Extermination</h2>
            <h3>Opinion</h3>
            <p>
Extermination is a process in the African-American Genocide that began post-Civil War with lynchings. The inexcusable slaughter of black people has been a traditional in America since it’s founding. The modern or contemporary lynching is police killing and those “Americans” exercising their right to stand their ground. The police killings are extremely disturbing because we are paying taxes to fund our murderers. Today the Extermination continues although modified and enacted in several ways. Extermination is not just murder, it includes systematic tactics like abortion and health care disparities. Poverty and other co-morbid conditions aid in reducing the life expectancy of Black Folks. The current Recipe for the Extermination of Black People in America:
<br/>
<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Poverty + Poor Education = Extermination
Food Deserts + Restrictive Access to Health Care = Poor Health (Extermination)
Criminalization of the Target Population Through Selective Application of the Law = Extermination </span>

            <h2>Extermination Defined By Genocide Watch</h2>
            <h3><a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html" target="_blank">From the 8 Stage of Genocide By Gregory  Stanton </a></h3>

          <p>
            <em>"EXTERMINATION begins, and quickly becomes the mass killing legally called “genocide.” It is “extermination” to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human. When it is sponsored by the state, the armed forces often work with militias to do the killing. Killing is described by euphemisms of purification. Sometimes the genocide results in revenge killings by groups against each other, creating the downward whirlpool-like cycle of bilateral genocide. </em>
