            <h3>   Racism In America</h3>

          <p>  Racism in America or <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">AMERACISM </span> is a disease, but it is also a structure. Racism is institutionalized and enforced through laws and regulation in the United States.  
            The first rule in treating diseases is to identify the pathogens or causes. American society is quick to point externally to the failings and inhumane treatment of people across the globe, wile turning a blind eye to the atrocities still being committed at home. Racism in America continues because the infected pass on the disease to their offspring. They encode education, politics, social behavior, and laws with racism to ensure that it prevails. America blames the victims of oppression on their condition, while taking no responsibility for their creation and efforts to sustain the institution.

        <p> We can no longer afford to await major media outlets to change thier practice of vilifing and crucifing Black people with no cause. Being a black victim means you must await the media to validate your humanity. We must rely on our news outlets and continue to create our own news outlets.
