<h2>Classification</h2>

<h3>Opinion</h3>

<p>Classification (the devaluation of the lives of a group of people by the dominant culture in power) Black people are already classified as Other and devalued as human beings. America is divided into White and other. The category of Other has many members but the defining member is African-Americans. The classification in America by race for empowerment of white people and enslabvement of black people has yet to be rectified. Unlike other genocides, in American Genocide idenifying the Other group is easy making further steps less complicated. American Genocide began with the Othering of people who were blessed with extensive pigmentation of the epidermis. Keep praying if you want but the systematic extermination of Black has begun and is ongoing while we turn the other way.</p>

<h2>Classification Defined by Genocide Watch</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html" target="_blank">From the 8 Stage of Genocide By Gregory Stanton </a></h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;All languages and cultures require classification - division of the natural and social world into categories. We distinguish and classify objects and people. All cultures have categories to distinguish between &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them,&rdquo; between members of our group and others. We treat different categories of people differently. Racial and ethnic classifications may be defined by absurdly detailed laws -- the Nazi Nuremberg laws, the &quot;one drop&quot; laws of segregation in America, or apartheid racial classification laws in South Africa. Racist societies often prohibit mixed categories and outlaw miscegenation. Bipolar societies are the most likely to have genocide.&rdquo; </em></p>
