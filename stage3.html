<h2>DeHumanization</h2>

<h3>Opinion</h3>

<p>The group defined as Other through <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stage1.html">Classification</a> has been reduced to being viewed as animals and vermin through Symbolization. Hate propaganda is spread through media and politics and used to vilify the group identified as Other. At this stage the murder of members of the group is no longer repulsive to the masses of society. Check out the comments section on any major news website following an article about a murdered African American child and you can read the horrible view point of the masses. There is more compassion and concern for lost animals after a natural disaster. Hate propaganda is continually spread through social media by members of the masses and oblivious or complacent African Americans. Dehumanization of black people and our lives is so prevalent among us that we ourselves devalue our own lives. Dehumanization of black people in America is so deeply rooted that young black men can kill each other without any sense of remorse.</p>

<h2>DeHumanization Defined by Genocide Watch</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html" target="_blank">From the 8 Stage of Genocide By Gregory Stanton </a></h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stage1.html">Classification</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stage2.html"> Symbolization</a> are fundamental operations in all cultures. They become steps of genocide only when combined with dehumanization. Denial of the humanity of others is the step that permits killing with impunity. The universal human abhorrence of murder of members of one&#39;s own group is overcome by treating the victims as less than human. &rdquo; </em></p>
